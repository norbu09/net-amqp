NAME
    Net::AMQP - Advanced Message Queue Protocol (de)serialization and
    representation

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::AMQP;

      Net::AMQP::Protocol->load_xml_spec('amqp0-8.xml');

      ...

      my @frames = Net::AMQP->parse_raw_frames(\$input);
      
  ...

      foreach my $frame (@frames) {
          if ($frame->can('method_frame') && $frame->method_frame->isa('Net::AMQP::Protocol::Connection::Start')) {
              my $output = Net::AMQP::Frame::Method->new(
                  channel => 0,
                  method_frame => Net::AMQP::Protocol::Connection::StartOk->new(
                      client_properties => { ... },
                      mechanism         => 'AMQPLAIN',
                      locale            => 'en_US',
                      response          => {
                          LOGIN    => 'guest',
                          PASSWORD => 'guest',
                      },
                  ),

          }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements the frame (de)serialization and representation of
    the Advanced Message Queue Protocol (http://www.amqp.org/). It is to be
    used in conjunction with client or server software that does the actual
    TCP/IP communication. While it's being written with AMQP version 0-8 in
    mind, as the spec is defined by an external xml file, support for 0-9,
    0-9-1 and eventually 0-10 is hoped for.

CLASS METHODS
  parse_raw_frames ($string_ref)
        Given a scalar reference to a binary string, return a list of
        Net::AMQP::Frame objects, consuming the data in the string. Croaks
        on invalid input.
